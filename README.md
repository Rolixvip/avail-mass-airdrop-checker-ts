# Avail Mass Airdrop Checker TS 

The `avail-mass-airdrop-checker-ts` is a TypeScript script designed to check mass eligibility of Ethereum (EVM) addresses for the Avail airdrop (AvailProject). This script utilizes Bun, a modern JavaScript runtime similar to Node.js, to efficiently handle the processing of multiple addresses. üíô

## Security

**Important Security Notes :**
- **Private Key Handling :** The private keys are not stored or sent to the AvailProject API. They are used solely to sign the message for Avail, and only the signed message is sent.
- **Caution :** Always ensure that your private keys are handled securely. Do not expose them in publicly accessible locations.
